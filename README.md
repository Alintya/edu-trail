### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 (for UUIDv7)
- Visual Studio 2022 or any IDE with .NET support
- PostgreSQL Server or Docker (compose)
- Preferably dotnet-ef for migration management (`dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`)

### Setup

#### Visual Studio

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alintya/edu-trail.git
   ```

2. Open `EduTrail.sln` and run the docker-compose project

#### Other like Visual Studio *Code*

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alintya/edu-trail.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd edu-trail
   ```

3. Run database

   a. Either standalone or using `docker compose up edutrail.db -d`

   b. (if standalone db) Modify the database connection in `src/EduTrail.WebUI/appsettings.Development.json` where necessary:

      ```json
      "ConnectionStrings": {
         "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=5432;Database=edutrail;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;"
      }
      ```

   c. (Optional) Apply migrations manually:

      ```bash
      dotnet ef database update -p src/EduTrail.Infrastructure -s src/EduTrail.WebUI
      ```

4. Run the application (or `dotnet watch` to hot-reload):

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/EduTrail.WebUI
   ```
